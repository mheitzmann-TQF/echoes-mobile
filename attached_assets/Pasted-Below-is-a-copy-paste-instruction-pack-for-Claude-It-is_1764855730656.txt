Below is a copy-paste instruction pack for Claude. It is blunt, implementation-oriented, and assumes source.thequietframe.com is canonical. No reinvention, no new “wisdom writing” unless it’s a minimal rewrite for tone/labels.

⸻

CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS — Echoes Mobile: Use SOURCE as Canonical Content (No Reinvention)

0) Non-negotiables
	1.	Do NOT invent new content. Use content already present in source.thequietframe.com (Sacred Geography Intelligence, Living Calendar Wisdom, Oral Tradition Wisdom, Consciousness Calendar, Cultural Context Intelligence).
	2.	Do NOT add accounts. Preferences remain on-device only.
	3.	Do NOT repeat Today snapshot content outside Today (calendar tiles + lunar/geomagnetism/coherence tiles + 5 echo cards remain only on Today).
	4.	Remove “accuracy %” claims and other fake-precision from any surfaced content (e.g., “75–85% accuracy”). Replace with “lens / tradition / heuristic” language if needed.
	5.	No directive coaching tone. Remove “you should”, “review your intentions”, “prepare”, etc. Use descriptive language.

⸻

1) Content Strategy (What the app should surface)

Canonical content pools (from Source)

A) Consciousness Calendar entries
	•	Tags like: cultural, religious, natural, and region/global labels.

B) Sacred Geography Intelligence items
	•	Phases 2A/2B/2C etc.

C) Living Calendar Wisdom items
	•	Includes systems like Vedic/Aztec etc.

D) Oral Tradition Wisdom items
	•	Includes indigenous/tradition-attributed items (e.g., Navajo Diné).

E) Cultural Offering / “Artifact of the day” items
	•	e.g. I Ching card already visible in Source.

Output rule

Mobile experience must be a curated viewer of these pools.

⸻

2) Data Plumbing (Do not reinvent endpoints)

Task

Locate the existing endpoints already used by Source (the web admin/dashboard) that return:
	•	consciousness calendar events list
	•	sacred geography items
	•	living calendar wisdom items
	•	oral tradition items
	•	cultural offering item

Then create a small mobile “content client” that queries the same endpoints.

Requirements
	•	Add a single ContentService module in the mobile app.
	•	Provide methods:
	•	getTodayBundle(location, tz, lang)
	•	getConsciousnessCalendar(range)
	•	getSacredGeographyToday(location)
	•	getLivingCalendarToday(location)
	•	getOralTraditionToday(location)
	•	getCulturalOffering(location)
	•	Caching:
	•	Cache results for 30 minutes or until expires_at if returned.
	•	Always fail gracefully with calm UI fallback (no blank pages, no infinite “loading…”).

⸻

3) Mapping / Label Cleanup (Stop leaking taxonomy keys)

Task

Implement a display-label layer so raw keys never appear in UI.

Rules:
	•	Convert snake_case ids to Title Case (“daily_sandhya” → “Daily Sandhya”).
	•	Convert tags like ayurvedic_timing to “Ayurvedic timing”.
	•	Hide raw system ids like hindu_vedic unless accompanied by a human label.
	•	For every content item, expose:
	•	title (human)
	•	subtitle (human)
	•	origin (tradition / people / region, if available)
	•	category_label (Observed / Traditional / Mythic / Reflective)
	•	tags_display[] (humanized)

⸻

4) Tone & Credibility Rules (must apply to ALL surfaced text)

Disallowed
	•	Universal claims: “thoughts get clearer”, “this causes…”
	•	Vague authority: “many traditional societies…”
	•	Instructional coaching: “review”, “prepare”, “you should…”
	•	Fake precision: “75–85% accurate”

Allowed rewrite (minimal)

You may lightly rewrite Source text ONLY to:
	•	remove directives
	•	remove fake precision
	•	add “lens” framing
	•	shorten to fit card UI

Example rewrite pattern:
	•	“Today is auspicious for…” → “Often treated as favorable for…”
	•	“Accuracy 75–85%” → remove; replace “Traditionally used for short-range local pattern reading.”

⸻

5) Screen-by-screen: EXACT behavior changes

A) TODAY tab (still 5 Echo cards, but sourced from Source)

Keep existing top tiles (calendars + 3 metrics).

Replace Echo card generation logic with curated Source selection.

Echo cards MUST be filled from Source pools using this fixed mix:
	1.	Lunar Wisdom (planetary_context lunar) — keep but ensure tone is non-directive.
	2.	Solar Rhythm (planetary_context solar) — non-directive.
	3.	Global Pulse (consciousness monitor / coherence narrative) — non-directive.
	4.	Cultural Date / Observance (from Consciousness Calendar)
	•	If none in next 7 days, pull nearest upcoming “cultural/religious/natural” within 90 days and label “Ahead”.
	5.	Living Tradition (rotate one daily from: Sacred Geography OR Oral Tradition OR Living Calendar Wisdom)
	•	Must include origin label visibly.

Important:
	•	Do not write new “wisdom paragraphs.” Use Source text + minimal cleanup.

⸻

B) FIELD tab (interpretation layer, not values repeated)

Field collapsed rows show:
	•	meaning line only + delta/trend only
Expanded shows:
	•	the actual value (once) + “how to read” + “common misread” + “inputs used”

Field copy must never contain advice like “how about a noon break…”

⸻

C) LEARN tab (Library Viewer of Source)

Learn shows 3 sections:
	1.	Calendar Systems Carousel (education, no dates on card face; date appears only in detail sheet)
	2.	Cultural Offering (from Source cultural content)
	3.	Explore (tabs or chips): Sacred Geography | Oral Tradition | Living Calendar
Each lists 3–5 cards/day with “Rotate lens” interaction.

If cultural offering API returns blank: render calm fallback card, not endless loading.

⸻

D) UPCOMING tab (must show Xmas AND “pagan / African / religious” from Source)

Upcoming uses 3 horizons:
	•	Soon (48h)
	•	Cycle (14d)
	•	Season (90d)

Upcoming must merge:
	1.	Planetary milestones (moon phases, etc.)
	2.	Consciousness Calendar entries (cultural/religious/natural/global)

Filtering chips must work:
	•	All
	•	Astronomical
	•	Cultural (includes religious + pagan + indigenous observances)
If categories are missing, map Source tags → these chips.

Empty state is forbidden. If no events:
	•	show timing windows (body/solar)
	•	show next lunar checkpoint
	•	show next seasonal turning point

⸻

6) Acceptance Tests (must pass)
	1.	A “Living Tradition” card appears on Today referencing Sacred Geography / Oral Tradition content with origin label.
	2.	No raw taxonomy keys appear anywhere (daily_sandhya, hindu_vedic, etc. are humanized).
	3.	No accuracy % claims appear in mobile UI.
	4.	Upcoming → Season shows more than Christmas/New Year when Source contains e.g. Beltane/Diwali/etc.
	5.	Field tab contains no advice (“take a break”) — only interpretation.
	6.	Learn tab never displays an infinite loader for cultural offering; fallback card appears within 1s when blank.

⸻

7) Deliverables (what to commit)
	•	ContentService.ts (or equivalent)
	•	labelize.ts (humanization + category mapping)
	•	Updated Today echo selection logic (uses Source pools)
	•	Updated Upcoming merged events logic (uses Consciousness Calendar)
	•	Updated Field copy (remove advice)
	•	Updated Learn Explore viewer

⸻

If Claude needs a “where to start” order:
	1.	Implement labelize.ts (stop ugly keys).
	2.	Wire Consciousness Calendar into Upcoming (proves cultural breadth).
	3.	Add Today “Living Tradition” card from Sacred Geography/Oral Tradition (proves depth).
	4.	Then refine Learn Explore viewer.

Done.
