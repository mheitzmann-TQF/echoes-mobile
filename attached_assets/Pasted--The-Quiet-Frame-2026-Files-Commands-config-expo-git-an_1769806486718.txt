Configurations
Configurations are similar to secrets, but should only be used for non-sensitive information. They're useful for having a variable that's different between your published app and when testing on Replit.
Enable "Accessible Terminal" in Workspace Settings to use a screen reader with the shell.

all numbers are still 0
no. better to figure out why the api fails
shall we?
Redesign the Learn tab as a “daily museum” with 4 sections:
1. Calendar Systems carousel (big swipeable cards). Cards show system name + type + 1-line explainer, but NO dates on the card. Tap opens a bottom sheet showing “Today in this system” with the date and details.
2. Artifact of the Day (one curated card) using /api/cultural/content/high-alignment. Replace infinite “Discovering…” with skeleton + calm fallback. Add local Save.
3. Living Calendar (2–3 cards) using /api/sacred-geography/living-calendars, each with a “Why now” line and a detail sheet.
4. Saved strip (local-only bookmarks).
Enforce anti-repeat: Learn must not re-render Today’s calendar tiles or Today’s metrics tiles.
where is the calendat system caroussel??? Here are the instructions again as it does not show in the preview:

for upcoming:
Expand Upcoming horizon beyond 7 days by splitting it into 3 bands with a segmented control: Soon (next 48h), Cycle (next 14 days), Season (next 90 days). Each band uses different UX (countdown cards for Soon, event list for Cycle, turning-point cards for Season). If the events endpoint supports range params, request larger windows; otherwise fetch a larger set and bucket client-side by date. Never show an empty page: each band must have fallback cards (timing windows for Soon, lunar milestones for Cycle, seasonal turning points for Season).
Upcoming must include cultural observances like Christmas. Right now it likely only queries /api/planetary/events, which won’t contain civil/religious/pagan dates. Update Upcoming to merge multiple event feeds:
• /api/planetary/events for astronomical/geomagnetic moments
• /api/important-dates/upcoming for civil/religious/cultural observances (e.g., Christmas)
If /api/important-dates/upcoming returns empty, render a fallback “Core Dates” list (small built-in table) so the UI never misses obvious dates. Then bucket everything into horizons (48h/14d/90d) and allow filtering by event category.
the all is not aggregating both astronomical and cultural
great. let's move to settings. is location working?
hmmm, i am in lausanne
does display in settings work? what should be done?
Good catch! The Display section is currently just static text—not functional. Let me make it interactive with Language and Theme selectors:
Perfect! I just made Display fully functional. Here's what changed:

Before: Just static text (Language: English, Theme: Dark)

Now:
✅ Language Selector – Tap to choose from 5 languages (English, Français, Deutsch, Español, 中文)
✅ Theme Selector – Tap to choose Dark or Light mode
✅ Modal Pickers – Clean modal pop-up with checkmarks showing selected option
✅ Chevron Icon – Shows rows are tappable

How it works:

Tap "Language" or "Theme" in Settings
Modal appears with options
Tap your choice → gets saved + modal closes
Checkmark shows which is selected
The selections are stored in component state (they'll reset on app reload, but for a mockup that's fine—you could add AsyncStorage later for persistence).

All 5 tabs are now fully functional! 🎉

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the issue:

getActiveSubscriptions: 1 found - You have an active subscription
TransactionId: 2000001112664736 - This is the OLD expired transaction ID being sent
HTTP 200 → free - Backend correctly says this old transaction is expired
The problem is the mobile app is sending the old transaction ID instead of the new one from your fresh subscription.

The backend is working correctly - it verified the old transaction and correctly returned "free" because that one expired. The app needs to:

Get the new transaction ID from getActiveSubscriptions (which found 1)
Send that NEW transaction ID for verification
Is the mobile app code using getActiveSubscriptions result to get the current transaction ID? Or is it caching the old one somewhere?

i attempt to puchase but it does not seem to connect to the store
no 2. wheel turns then nothing. 3. yes
wait a second. we could purchase before. in fact we did once. after fixing the api we cannot purchase anymore????
i am using my apple id. do i have an active subscription? I do not think so
That's the issue! For TestFlight testing, you cannot use your real Apple ID for purchases.
