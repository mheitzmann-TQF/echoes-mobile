Echoes – Skeptic FAQs

1. Is Echoes judging the news or saying some content is “bad”?

No. Echoes does not evaluate truth, quality, or intent.
It looks at narrative patterns — whether content emphasizes reactive conflict or integrative understanding — without making moral or editorial judgments.

⸻

2. Is Echoes measuring truth, bias, or political orientation?

No. Echoes does not assess factual accuracy, ideology, or political stance.
It analyzes how stories are framed, not whether they are right or wrong.

⸻

3. What does “filtered signal” actually mean?

The filtered view removes content dominated by reactive loops such as fear, outrage, and division.
What remains is not “better news,” but a different pattern — one focused on solutions, context, and integration.

⸻

4. Why include lunar or solar information at all?

Planetary data is provided as context, not explanation or prediction.
It reflects environmental rhythms humans have historically tracked, without claiming causal effects on behavior or mood.

⸻

5. Is Echoes personalized or tracking me?

No. Echoes requires no account and builds no user profile.
Nothing you read is stored, tracked, or used to shape future content.

⸻

6. Why is Echoes paid instead of free?

Because free platforms depend on attention incentives.
Echoes is paid so it doesn’t need ads, engagement optimization, or emotional amplification — and can remain restrained by design.

⸻

Optional ultra-short version (for App Store review notes)

Echoes analyzes narrative patterns in global media without judging truth or intent. It shows both unfiltered and filtered views, offers planetary data as context only, requires no account, and is paid to avoid attention-driven incentives.
