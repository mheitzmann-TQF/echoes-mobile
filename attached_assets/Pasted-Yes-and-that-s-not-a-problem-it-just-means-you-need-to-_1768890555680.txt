Yes — and that’s not a problem, it just means you need to be deliberate about how the door works.

The good news: this is a solved pattern.
You don’t need two different cards, and you don’t need logic in the UI.

⸻

The correct solution: one URL, two stores

You do not link directly to either store from the card.

You use one canonical URL that resolves to the right place.

Example

https://space.thequietframe.com/enter

That URL does exactly one thing:
	•	If the app is installed → open it
	•	If not → send to the correct store (iOS or Android)

This is standard practice and works cleanly.

⸻

How it works (conceptually, not implementation-heavy)

Step 1 — Universal / App Links
	•	iOS: Universal Links
	•	Android: App Links

Both platforms allow your app to claim ownership of a URL.

So:
	•	iOS knows: “space.thequietframe.com belongs to this app”
	•	Android knows the same

If the app is installed → it opens directly.

⸻

Step 2 — Smart fallback if not installed

If the OS can’t open the app:
	•	iOS → App Store
	•	Android → Play Store

The OS already knows which one applies.

You don’t need to detect anything in JS.

⸻

What the future card does (very simple)

The card contains:

"link": {
  "url": "https://space.thequietframe.com/enter",
  "label": "Enter the space"
}

That’s it.

No platform logic.
No branching.
No duplication.

⸻

What NOT to do
	•	❌ Don’t link directly to App Store
	•	❌ Don’t show “Download on iOS / Android”
	•	❌ Don’t ask which device they’re on
	•	❌ Don’t open a browser explanation first

All of that breaks the sense of crossing a boundary.

⸻

If you want a minimal threshold page (optional)

If you feel the App Store page alone is too abrupt, you can do this:

space.thequietframe.com/enter
   ↓
(space not installed)
   ↓
Very minimal web page
   ↓
Store

But if you do this, the page must be:
	•	Extremely sparse
	•	Same tone as the card
	•	No marketing language
	•	One button only

Otherwise, skip it.

⸻

One important nuance (worth noting)

Because speech-to-speech needs permissions (mic, audio):

The first screen inside the Space app should gently acknowledge that:

“This space works with voice.
You’ll be asked for microphone access.”

This avoids surprise and builds trust.

That message belongs inside Space, not in World.

⸻

Final mental model (lock this in)
	•	World → names the existence of Space
	•	The link → is a door
	•	The OS → decides which store
	•	Space → explains itself

Clean. Honest. Future-proof.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Define the exact deep-link format (with context payload)
	•	Decide whether to remember the source (“from Wisdom”)
	•	Design the first-time Space onboarding so it feels continuous

You’re asking exactly the right questions.
