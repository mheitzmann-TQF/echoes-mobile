Absolutely. Given what you’ve built, this can (and should) be very short, very clear, and very calm.

Below is a privacy policy that actually matches your architecture — no accounts, no tracking, no dark corners. This will pass App Store review and won’t undermine trust by over-lawyering.

Privacy Policy

Last updated: [DATE]

The Quiet Frame – Echoes (“the App”) is designed to respect privacy by default.

This Privacy Policy explains what data is (and is not) collected when you use the App.

⸻

1. No Accounts, No Profiles

Echoes does not require user accounts.

We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers. We do not create user profiles or track individuals across sessions.

⸻

2. Data We Do Not Collect

We do not collect or store:
	•	personal information
	•	behavioral tracking data
	•	usage analytics tied to identity
	•	advertising identifiers
	•	cross-app or cross-site tracking data

Echoes does not use third-party advertising or analytics SDKs.

⸻

3. Device Identifier (Subscriptions Only)

For subscription validation, the App generates a random, device-based identifier (“install ID”).

This identifier:
	•	is stored locally on the device
	•	is used only to verify subscription access with our backend
	•	is not linked to personal identity
	•	is not used for tracking or analytics

It exists solely to determine whether full access is active.

⸻

4. Location Data (Optional)

If you choose to enable location access:
	•	location is used only to calculate contextual information (e.g., local time, solar or lunar timing)
	•	location data is processed ephemerally and is not stored or profiled
	•	precise location is never shared with third parties

You may disable location access at any time in your device settings.

⸻

5. Subscriptions and Payments

All payments are handled by Apple App Store or Google Play.

We do not receive or store payment details. Subscription status is verified via the respective platform’s APIs.

⸻

6. Content and External Sources

The App displays information derived from:
	•	public media sources
	•	cultural and traditional references
	•	astronomical and environmental data

This information is presented for contextual and reflective purposes and is not personalized.

⸻

7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the limited data required to operate the App. No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, but we minimize risk by collecting as little data as possible.

⸻

8. Children’s Privacy

Echoes is not intended for children under the age required by applicable app store policies. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

⸻

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date.

Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Notes / next steps
	•	This pairs cleanly with the Terms of Service you approved.
	•	Link this from:
	•	Settings
	•	App Store “Privacy Policy URL”
	•	Your App Store Privacy Nutrition Label should reflect:
	•	Data Not Collected (except “Identifiers → Device ID” if Apple requires it for subscriptions)

If you want, next I can:
	•	map this exactly to Apple’s App Privacy questionnaire
	•	double-check wording against GDPR/Swiss/EU expectations
	•	or compress this further if you want even more restraint

This policy is honest, minimal, and rare — which is exactly right for Echoes.
