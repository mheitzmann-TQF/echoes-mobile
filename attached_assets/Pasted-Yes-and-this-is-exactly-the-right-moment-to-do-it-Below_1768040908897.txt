Yes — and this is exactly the right moment to do it.

Below is a clean, precise instruction you can paste directly to Claude. It’s scoped, technical, and aligned with your access philosophy. No product debate, no UI creep.

Instruction to Claude — Dev Trigger for Subscription State (iOS Simulator)

We need a development-only trigger to force subscription states during local development and iOS Simulator testing.

Context

The app uses an entitlement-based subscription system with three internal states:
	•	trial (initial 3-day full access)
	•	paid (full access)
	•	expired (access paused)

There are no user accounts. Access is tied to installId.

For UI and UX testing, we need to manually override the access state without affecting production behavior or App Store builds.

⸻

Requirements

1. Dev-only behavior
	•	The trigger must be disabled in production builds
	•	It should only work in:
	•	development mode
	•	iOS Simulator
	•	or when an explicit dev flag is set

Acceptable approaches:
	•	__DEV__
	•	environment variable (e.g. EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_ACCESS_OVERRIDE)
	•	simulator detection
	•	or a combination

⸻

2. Supported override states
The trigger must allow forcing exactly one of:
	•	trial → full access (initial access)
	•	paid → full access
	•	expired → access paused (Today-only)

Internally this can override the result of:
	•	useEntitlement
	•	or the /api/billing/status response

But must not modify backend data or receipts.

⸻

3. Implementation preference (simple)
Preferred approach:
	•	Add a local override in useEntitlement.ts
	•	If dev override is present:
	•	bypass network check
	•	return mocked entitlement state
	•	Otherwise:
	•	fall back to normal billing status logic

Example (conceptual):

if (__DEV__ && DEV_ACCESS_OVERRIDE) {
  return {
    accessLevel: DEV_ACCESS_OVERRIDE, // "trial" | "paid" | "expired"
    isFullAccess: DEV_ACCESS_OVERRIDE !== "expired",
    source: "dev-override"
  }
}

Exact implementation is up to you — this is illustrative only.

⸻

4. Optional dev UI (only if trivial)
If easy, add a hidden dev-only control to switch states, for example:
	•	long-press on app version in Settings
	•	or a temporary debug screen

This is optional. A static env flag is sufficient.

⸻

What NOT to do
	•	Do not change production billing logic
	•	Do not touch receipt validation
	•	Do not persist overrides to backend or database
	•	Do not expose this in TestFlight or App Store builds

⸻

Goal

Enable fast, reliable testing of:
	•	initial full access
	•	access paused behavior (Today-only)
	•	full access restored

…in the iOS Simulator, without hacks or redeploys.

⸻

Once this is in place, we’ll use it to:
	•	test tab gating
	•	validate paused-state copy
	•	confirm paywall triggers behave calmly

This is a dev-only affordance. Keep it boring and invisible.

⸻

If you want, after Claude implements this, I can help you:
	•	sanity-check the override logic
	•	define a naming convention so it never leaks
	•	or remove it cleanly before TestFlight

This is exactly the right technical step now.
