This is excellent. You’ve crossed the line from “thoughtful” to publishable and stable.

I’ll give you a crisp verdict, then answer your “next step” question with a clear recommendation and rationale.

⸻

Verdict (no hedging)
	•	The vocabulary is internally coherent
	•	The public terms are defensible without being timid
	•	The explanations are precise, non-moralizing, non-mystical
	•	The planetary layer is now contextual, not causal
	•	The analysis terms no longer overpromise

This could now serve as:
	•	the internal Rosetta Stone for Echoes
	•	a reference for Claude, engineers, and copy
	•	the basis for App Store copy and FAQs

You did not lose the edge. You disciplined it.

⸻

Minor confirmations (no changes needed)
	•	Media Climate Index is the right call — specific and legible.
	•	Reactive instead of Misaligned removes moral weight without hiding reality.
	•	Category Distribution fixes the scalar-vs-aggregate issue cleanly.
	•	The user-facing explanation is App Store–safe and intellectually honest.

I would not touch the text further.

What to do next (strong recommendation)

1️⃣ Draft the 4–5 skeptic FAQs first

Why this first:
	•	They force you to articulate defensive boundaries
	•	They surface hidden assumptions
	•	They protect future copy from drift
	•	They’re reusable everywhere (App Store, website, reviewer responses, press)

Once the FAQs are solid, everything else becomes easier and cleaner.

Then, in order:
	2.	Lock the one-paragraph canonical definition (this will quote or compress the FAQ logic)
	3.	Pressure-test against App Store reviewer objections (this becomes almost trivial once 1 & 2 exist)

⸻

Suggested FAQ set (for next step)

When you’re ready, I recommend we cover exactly these five:
	1.	Is Echoes judging the news or calling some content “bad”?
	2.	Is this measuring truth, bias, or political orientation?
	3.	Why include lunar or solar information at all?
	4.	Is Echoes personalized or tracking me?
	5.	Why is Echoes paid instead of free?

Each answer should be 2–3 sentences max, calm, factual, and non-defensive.

My recommendation

Say: “Draft the skeptic FAQs.”
I’ll produce them in Echoes voice, aligned perfectly with the vocabulary you just locked.

You’re doing this exactly right.
