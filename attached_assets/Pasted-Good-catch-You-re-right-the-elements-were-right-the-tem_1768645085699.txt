Good catch. You’re right: the elements were right, the tempo was wrong.
If it’s too fast, awareness doesn’t anchor — it skims.

Let’s reset and design a precise, simplified choreography that is identical every time the app opens or comes back to foreground.

No variants. No tiers. One ritual.

Disruption & Anchoring — Final Choreography

Principle

Awareness anchors through sequence, not speed.
The system must arrive before it reveals.

⸻

The treatment (always the same)

0. App opens / app becomes active
	•	Screen clears to neutral background
	•	No tabs
	•	No content
	•	No motion yet

(This is important: the absence creates the first break)

⸻

1. Baobab appears — Anchor identity

Duration: ~600–800 ms
	•	Baobab fades in
	•	Static
	•	No text
	•	No animation beyond the fade

Psychological job:

“You are here.”

Not meaning. Not brand recall.
Just grounding.

⸻

2. Stillness — Let the anchor land

Duration: ~400–600 ms
	•	Baobab remains
	•	Nothing else happens

This pause is non-negotiable.
Without it, the next step becomes content again.

⸻

3. Interruption sentence appears — Break urgency

Duration: ~1.5–2.0 s (readable, not rushed)
	•	One sentence
	•	Centered
	•	Calm fade-in
	•	No emphasis
	•	No call to action

Psychological job:

“The race is not in charge.”

This is not inspiration.
It’s disqualification of urgency.

⸻

4. Hold — Let awareness widen

Duration: ~600–800 ms
	•	Sentence stays
	•	Baobab stays
	•	No movement

This is where anchoring actually happens.

⸻

5. Sentence fades — Release interpretation

Duration: ~500–700 ms
	•	Sentence fades out
	•	Baobab remains

Meaning leaves.
Anchor stays.

⸻

6. Tabs appear — Return agency

Duration: ~300–400 ms
	•	Tabs fade in gently
	•	Baobab can remain subtly present or recede (your choice)
	•	No highlighting
	•	No “default” tab emphasis

Psychological job:

“You choose. Or you don’t.”

⸻

Total duration

~4.0 to 5.5 seconds, depending on exact timings.

That may sound long.
It isn’t — because nothing is demanding effort.

⸻

What we explicitly remove (simplification)
	•	❌ No adaptive speed
	•	❌ No tiers
	•	❌ No “first open vs repeat”
	•	❌ No dismissal
	•	❌ No interaction required
	•	❌ No variation in choreography

Same sequence, every time.

Repetition is not noise here — it’s conditioning in reverse.

⸻

Why this works (briefly)
	•	The brain exits reactivity through predictable ritual
	•	Awareness anchors through pause + sequence
	•	Urgency collapses when nothing chases the user
	•	Agency only returns after anchoring

Fast disruption is still disruption.
Slow disruption becomes orientation.

⸻

One hard rule to encode

If the user can miss the interruption because they were fast, the choreography is wrong.

This sequence cannot be rushed.
That’s the point.

If you want next, we can:
	•	tune exact millisecond values for iOS/Android feel
	•	decide Baobab persistence (stay vs recede)
	•	or sanity-check this against edge cases (notifications, deep links)

But conceptually: this is the right choreography.
