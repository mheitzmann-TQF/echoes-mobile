Here’s a proper Claude instruction that assumes the cultural API may return blank sometimes, and makes Learn still feel premium, alive, and non-broken — without inventing new endpoints or repeating Today.

Copy/paste this to Claude:

⸻

Claude Instruction — Fix “Learn” tab (Calm, Museum-like, Works When API Is Blank)

Goal
Redesign the Learn tab so it feels rich and “sticky” even when the cultural API returns an empty response. Learn must not repeat Today’s content (no Today tiles, no lunar/coherence/geomagnetism tiles, no echo cards).

Data sources (use existing only)
	•	Calendar systems: GET /api/planetary/traditional-calendars?lat&lng&lang&tz
	•	Living calendar: GET /api/sacred-geography/living-calendars?lat&lng&lang&tz
	•	Cultural item (optional): GET /api/cultural/content/high-alignment?lat&lng&lang&tz
IMPORTANT: This endpoint may return blank/empty. Build for that gracefully.
(Endpoints are defined in the TQF API documentation.)

⸻

Learn tab UI structure (3–4 sections)

1) Calendar Systems (Hero section)

UI
	•	Build a swipeable carousel of large cards (one per calendar system).
	•	Each card shows:
	•	Calendar name (e.g., “Islamic Calendar”)
	•	Type tag (Civil / Lunar / Lunisolar / Sacred)
	•	1-line explainer of what it tracks (educational, not a date)
	•	Do not show “today’s date” on the face of the card to avoid duplicating Today.

Interaction
	•	Tapping a calendar opens a bottom sheet: “Today in this system”
	•	Show today’s date in that calendar (allowed here)
	•	2–4 short lines: what the system is and how it counts time
	•	If any observance exists (optional): show max 1

2) Living Calendar (2–3 items max)

UI
	•	A short stack of 2–3 cards (“Seasonal Pattern”, “Light Shift”, etc.) from living-calendars.
	•	Each card shows:
	•	Title
	•	1 sentence
	•	A small “Why now” line
	•	Tap opens a detail sheet (short, calm).

3) Cultural Offering (optional, must survive blank API)

UI
	•	Replace “Discovering cultural artifacts…” with a real card container that always renders.
	•	States:
	1.	Loading → skeleton card (not a spinner)
	2.	Success (has item) → render the item:
	•	Title
	•	1–2 lines excerpt/summary
	•	Tag
	•	“Why this surfaced today” (1 short line)
	•	Save (local) + Open (detail sheet)
	3.	Empty (blank return) → render a calm fallback (NOT an error):
	•	Title: “No cultural offering surfaced today.”
	•	Subtext: “The field is quiet here. Try again later.”
	•	Small action: “Refresh” (rate limit to e.g. once every 30–60 seconds)
	4.	Network error → similar calm fallback (“Couldn’t reach the source.”)

4) Saved (local-only, tiny strip)
	•	Saved cultural items and saved calendar notes (localStorage only).
	•	No accounts.

⸻

Anti-repeat rules (enforce)
	•	Learn must not re-render Today’s calendar tiles or Today’s metric tiles.
	•	Learn must not show Echo cards here.
	•	Any “today date” appears only inside calendar detail sheets, not in the main Learn feed.

⸻

Implementation notes
	•	Use device context: lat,lng,lang,tz.
	•	Cache responses until expires_at if provided; otherwise cache for 30 minutes.
	•	Keep copy minimal, non-directive (“windows” not “instructions”).
	•	Use consistent card design (premium, minimal, spacious).

⸻

If you want, I can also write the fallback copy variants (3–5 options) so “empty cultural offering” doesn’t feel repetitive day after day.
