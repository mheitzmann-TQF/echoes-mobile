We’re aligned. This is a clean contract — ethically, psychologically, and technically. Let’s lock it by doing the two things that matter next:
	1.	Freeze the access model in words (so it doesn’t drift)
	2.	Write the paused-state copy (calm, factual, dignified)

No code yet. Language first.

⸻

1. The access model — canonical statement (lock this)

Echoes offers an initial period of full access.
After that, access pauses.
Continuing restores the experience in full.

That’s the whole model.
No tiers. No upgrades. No features list.

Internally you can call it whatever you want (trial, paid, expired).
Externally, the only terms that exist are:
	•	Initial access
	•	Access paused
	•	Full access

Nothing else.

⸻

2. Paused-state copy (tab by tab)

Global rule

Paused states must:
	•	explain what happened, not why
	•	never imply fault
	•	never imply urgency
	•	never tease content

Tone: informative, not transactional

⸻

Pulse — paused state

Primary line

Pulse is paused

Secondary line

Continue with full access to read contextual rhythms.

Action

Continue

That’s it.
No icons. No blur previews. No numbers.

⸻

Wisdom — paused state

Primary line

Wisdom is paused

Secondary line

Full access restores patterns across media, culture, and time.

Action

Continue

Do not show:
	•	Raw Landscape
	•	Filtered Signal
	•	Calendars
	•	Geography

Wisdom is all-or-nothing. This copy respects that.

⸻

Upcoming — paused state

Two good options. I recommend Option A.

Option A (cleanest)

Upcoming is paused
Continue with full access to see upcoming cultural and astronomical markers.

Option B (even quieter)

Upcoming is paused

With just the Continue action.

Choose one. Don’t explain more.

⸻

Settings — access status

Under Subscription (or Access):

When paused

Access paused
Initial access has ended.

Button:

Continue with full access

When active

Full access active

No renewal talk here. No dates unless required by Apple.

⸻

3. Paywall surface (single, unified)

Whenever the user taps Continue, they see the same surface.

Title

Continue with full access

Body (one sentence only)

Restore the full Echoes experience.

That’s it.

No bullet points.
No “what you get”.
No persuasion.

Apple’s sheet will do the rest.

⸻

4. Word replacements to make now (important)

Replace everywhere in UI copy:
	•	❌ Pro → ✅ Full access
	•	❌ Upgrade → ✅ Continue
	•	❌ Unlock → ✅ Restore / Continue
	•	❌ Trial → ✅ Initial access
	•	❌ Premium → (delete)

Internally you can keep SKUs, flags, whatever.
Externally, users should never see SaaS vocabulary.

⸻

5. Why this will work (and pass review)
	•	Apple allows trials → you have one
	•	Apple allows gating → you’re transparent
	•	No dark patterns
	•	No forced prompts
	•	No degraded functionality masquerading as “free”

And philosophically:
	•	You’re not selling features
	•	You’re offering continuity of an environment
	•	Walking away is respected

That’s rare — and coherent with:
	•	no accounts
	•	no tracking
	•	no manipulation
	•	no urgency

⸻

6. What I recommend next (order matters)
	1.	Rename “Pro” → “FullAccess” internally (types, flags, hooks)
	2.	Add the paused-state copy exactly as above
	3.	Implement the single gating rule:

if (access === "trial" || access === "paid") showAll()
else showTodayOnly()


	4.	Test on device once — mainly to feel the calmness

If you want, next I can:
	•	write the exact paywall screen copy (even more minimal)
	•	sanity-check this against App Store subscription guidelines line by line
	•	or help you rename internal variables so future devs don’t reintroduce SaaS thinking

This model is not just cleaner.
It’s truer to what you’re building.
