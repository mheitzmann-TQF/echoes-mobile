You’re right — two hard problems jump out immediately, one data bug, one product/voice bug.

1) Data bug: “Sunset in 453h” is broken

That’s ~18.9 days. So one of these is happening:
	•	you’re calculating time_to_sunset against the wrong date (epoch / UTC offset bug)
	•	you’re using the wrong field (e.g., time to seasonal transition) but labeling it “sunset”
	•	you’re mixing seconds vs hours (e.g., seconds treated as hours)
	•	timezone/location mismatch (Settings says UTC in one screenshot earlier; now you’re using a location)

Fix rules
	•	time_to_sunset must be computed as sunset_time_local - now_local and displayed as hh:mm not “453h”.
	•	If the value > 24h, do NOT show it. Replace with “Sunset at 17:06” (local time).
	•	If sunset already passed, show “Sunset tomorrow at …” and compute next day.

Claude patch instruction (copy/paste)

Fix the Solar expanded card time math: “Sunset in 453h” indicates a timezone/units bug. Compute time_to_sunset using local sunset timestamp minus local now. Display as “Sunset in 3h 12m” if < 24h. If >= 24h, display “Sunset at HH:MM” (local) or “Sunset tomorrow at HH:MM” if already passed. Never show multi-day hours.

2) Field tab voice is wrong: it’s mixing “cultural anecdotes” into a signal explainer

Field is supposed to be: how the signal is shaped (definitions + interpretation).
But you’ve got lines like:
	•	“People say when the waxing gibbou…”
	•	“At noon, Berber folks sip mint tea…”

That belongs in Learn (culture), not Field (signal). It makes Field feel random and untrustworthy.

Fix rules
	•	Field collapsed summaries must be meaning labels, not stories.
	•	Field expanded content must be definition + how-to-read + misread, plus “used in echoes”.
	•	Cultural examples (Berber tea etc.) should only appear in Learn, or in a dedicated “Cultural lens” card.

Claude patch instruction

Remove cultural anecdotes from Field. Field is an explainer layer, not a cultural story feed. Collapsed rows must be meaning-only summaries (no “people say…”). Expanded views must include: (1) definition of the signal, (2) how to read it today, (3) common misread, (4) inputs used. Any cultural example text belongs in Learn (or a separate Cultural Lens module), not Field.

3) UI/content hierarchy problem: expanded card feels empty + misweighted

The expanded Solar card shows:
	•	“midday”
	•	“Sunset in 453h”
	•	then “Reading notes” and chips

What’s missing is the actual explainer in plain language.

Fix
Expanded card should have this order:
	1.	Signal state (e.g., “Midday”)
	2.	What it means (1–2 lines)
	3.	Today’s read (1 line, non-directive)
	4.	Next transition (sunset time, correctly computed)
	5.	Reading notes (bullets)
	6.	Used in echoes (chips)

Claude patch instruction

Restructure Field expanded cards to prioritize meaning: State → Meaning → Today’s read → Next transition (correct time) → Notes → Used-in-echoes chips. Avoid showing chips before the explanation.

⸻

Bonus: your “Geomagnetic” row shows “Calm conditions.” and badge “unsettled”

That’s a contradiction (calm vs unsettled). Likely you’re displaying:
	•	description from one field + status badge from another mapped wrongly.

Claude instruction

Resolve geomagnetic label contradiction: don’t show “Calm” while tagging “unsettled.” Ensure the badge derives from the same normalized state as the headline. If kp_index <=2 label “Quiet”; 3–4 “Active”; >=5 “Stormy”. Badge must match.

The one-line diagnosis

Field is trying to be Learn + Today + Field at once, and the solar time math is busted.

If you want, I can write a “golden template” for each Field card (Lunar/Solar/Coherence/Geomagnetic/Body) with exact copy slots so Claude can implement without drifting.
