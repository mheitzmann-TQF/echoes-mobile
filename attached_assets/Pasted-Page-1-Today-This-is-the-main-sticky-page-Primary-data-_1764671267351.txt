Page 1: Today (/)

This is the main sticky page.

Primary data

Call:
	•	GET /api/echoes/daily-bundle?lat={}&lng={}&lang={}&tz={}

Use this response to render:
	•	field_temperature (compute if not provided)
	•	echo_cards[] (the core swipe stack)
	•	light_context (sunlight/day length if present)
	•	weather_context (temp, conditions, feels-like if present)
	•	lunar_context (phase, illumination, moon visibility)
	•	cultural_context (today’s observances if present)

Layout (top to bottom)

A) Hero: “Today’s Echo”
	•	Title: primary echo name (from the first/featured card)
	•	One line: short interpretive line
	•	Mood temperature: a dial/bar with label (e.g. “Field temperature: Warm / 68”)

B) Calendar Carousel (inline)

This is your request: circling through calendars is an experience.
	•	Row title: “Today across calendars”
	•	A swipeable carousel OR chip row where tapping switches the displayed calendar card.
	•	Each calendar card shows:
	•	Calendar name
	•	Today date in that system
	•	One tiny line: what kind of calendar it is (lunar / lunisolar / religious / civil)

Interaction:
	•	Swipe left/right cycles calendars (snap)
	•	Tap “i” opens a bottom sheet: 3–6 lines explaining that calendar and what today means (if available)

Data:
	•	Use daily-bundle if it already includes calendar outputs; if not, call:
	•	GET /api/planetary/traditional-calendars?lang={}&tz={}&lat={}&lng={}
Cache: daily (or until expires)

C) Context chips (tap-to-learn)

A single row of chips:
	•	🌙 Lunar: “Waxing gibbous · 78%”
	•	☀️ Solar: “Afternoon light”
	•	🌡 Weather: “3°C · Clear”
	•	🗓 Culture: “2 observances”

Each chip opens a bottom sheet with deeper explanation (but never huge walls of text).

D) Swipe stack: Echo Cards

Render echo_cards[] as a swipeable stack (or vertical cards if you prefer).
Card template:
	•	Label (Lunar / Solar / Body / Culture / World)
	•	Title (2–4 words)
	•	One short line (max ~140 chars)
	•	Optional: tiny “source” / “signal” line
	•	Actions:
	•	“Save” (local only)
	•	“Share” (generates share image or link)
	•	“Why?” (bottom sheet showing raw inputs used: lunar phase, seasonal info etc.)
