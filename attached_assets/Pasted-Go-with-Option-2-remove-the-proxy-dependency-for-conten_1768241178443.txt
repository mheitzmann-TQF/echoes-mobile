Go with Option 2: remove the proxy dependency for content — but do it in two safe steps so you don’t break anything mid-flight.

Decision
	•	Yes: Source should expose public content endpoints without an API key (daily-bundle, calendars, observances, etc.), protected by rate limiting + basic abuse controls.
	•	Yes: The app should call source directly for content, same as billing (billing stays session-token protected).
	•	No: The app should not ship with TQF_API_KEY in any form.
	•	No: You don’t need local /api/proxy/* routes in the app once source is public for content.

Instruction to Claude (App) — what to do now

Keep the proxy routes temporarily as fallback, but implement direct calls:
	1.	Add a “contentBaseUrl = EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL” direct fetch path for:

	•	/api/echoes/daily-bundle
	•	/api/planetary/traditional-calendars
	•	/api/planetary/biological-rhythms
	•	/api/observances/upcoming (or whatever route you standardize)

	2.	Feature flag the switch:

	•	EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_SOURCE_DIRECT=true (default true in dev once source supports it)
	•	If direct call returns 401/403/404, fallback to proxy route for now (so you don’t get stuck).

	3.	Once confirmed stable:

	•	Remove /app/api/proxy/*
	•	Remove TQF_API_KEY from the app repo entirely
	•	Delete lib/env.ts references that expose it

Instruction to Claude (Source) — what must be true first

On source.thequietframe.com, change policy to:

Public, no API key
	•	GET /api/echoes/daily-bundle
	•	GET /api/planetary/traditional-calendars
	•	GET /api/planetary/biological-rhythms
	•	GET /api/observances/...

Protected (Bearer session token)
	•	GET /api/billing/status
	•	POST /api/billing/verify
	•	(S2S stays separate/hardened)

Abuse controls for public endpoints
	•	IP rate limit (and/or CDN/WAF if you add it later)
	•	Request validation (lat/lng ranges, tz length, lang code whitelist)
	•	Cache aggressively (you already do hits)

Answer to the question in your message

“Would you like me to update the content endpoints to call source directly once it’s configured for public access? Or keep proxy?”

Update content endpoints to call source directly, and keep proxy only as a temporary fallback until source is confirmed public.

If you paste the current app API client file (lib/api.ts or wherever daily-bundle/calendars are fetched), I’ll tell you exactly where to cut over cleanly (minimal diff).
