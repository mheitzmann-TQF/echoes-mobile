📐 Claude Instruction — UI Refinement Pass (No Feature Changes)

Objective
Improve visual hierarchy and reading ease without changing layout, behavior, or features.
This is a cosmetic refinement only.

⸻

1️⃣ Typography Hierarchy (Primary vs Context)

Do not introduce new fonts.

Apply these rules consistently across all screens:
	•	Primary content (main titles, Echo text, key statements):
	•	Increase font size by +4–6%
	•	OR slightly increase contrast (e.g. from gray-300 → gray-200 equivalent)
	•	Secondary / contextual content (labels, tags, percentages, metadata):
	•	Slightly reduce contrast
	•	Slightly reduce line height
	•	Keep readable, never “disabled”

Goal: the eye should immediately land on the primary message.

⸻

2️⃣ Vertical Rhythm Standardization

Audit spacing and normalize to only these vertical gaps:
	•	16px (tight grouping)
	•	24px (related sections)
	•	32px (section breaks)
	•	48px (major transitions)

Rules:
	•	Headers get more space above than below
	•	Cards never appear “almost touching”
	•	No arbitrary spacing values

⸻

3️⃣ Reduce Repetition Fatigue (Text Only)

Without deleting content:
	•	Identify repeated explanatory phrases (e.g. “A fictional reflection for quiet contemplation”)
	•	Render them:
	•	Smaller
	•	Lighter
	•	Or only once per screen/session

Do not rewrite copy unless strictly necessary.

⸻

4️⃣ One Visual Anchor (Single Location Only)

Choose one key screen (Today or Field):
	•	Add a subtle distinction:
	•	Slightly softer glow
	•	Slightly different shadow
	•	Or marginally increased card radius

Constraints:
	•	Only ONE location
	•	No new colors
	•	No animation

⸻

5️⃣ Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT do these)
	•	❌ No layout restructuring
	•	❌ No animations
	•	❌ No new components
	•	❌ No onboarding or copy rewrites
	•	❌ No color palette changes

⸻

6️⃣ Output Requirements

After changes, provide:
	•	A short summary list of what was adjusted
	•	Confirmation that no logic, navigation, or API code was touched

⸻

Tone & Judgment

Err on the side of under-doing.
If unsure, do nothing rather than over-style.
