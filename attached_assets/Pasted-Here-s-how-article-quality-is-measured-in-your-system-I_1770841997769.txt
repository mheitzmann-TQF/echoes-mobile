Here's how article quality is measured in your system. It's a 5-stage filtering pipeline:

Stage 1 — Shallow Content Pre-filter
Before any AI gets involved, articles are rejected instantly if they contain clickbait/trending language like "breaking," "shocking," "slams," "fury," etc. This is a simple keyword check that cuts out obvious noise.

Stage 2 — Depth Check
Articles with fewer than 100 characters (title + summary combined) are rejected as too brief to carry meaningful wisdom.

Stage 3 — AI Scoring (the core measurement)
Each surviving article is sent to GPT-4o with a detailed prompt asking it to rate the article on a 0–10 "TQF score." The AI is instructed to look for:

Contemplative wisdom and inner reflection
Cultural wisdom and indigenous knowledge
Community empowerment and social innovation
Environmental consciousness
Spiritual depth and universal themes
It's also told to reject:

Political conflicts, crime, celebrity gossip, sports scores
Financial speculation, war coverage, scandal reporting
Breaking news without deeper meaning
The AI returns a score, a category (wisdom/innovation/culture/environment/spiritual/community/reject), reasoning, and universal themes.

Stage 4 — Timeless Wisdom Boost
If the article contains words like "ancient," "traditional," "wisdom," "indigenous," "meditation," or "consciousness," it gets a +1 point bonus to its score.

Stage 5 — Strict Threshold
Only articles scoring 7 or higher out of 10 are accepted. Articles scoring 5–6 are deliberately rejected to maintain exceptional quality. Articles scoring 4 or below are hard rejected.

After acceptance, a second, more detailed AI analysis runs on accepted articles, producing richer metadata: TQF alignment (0–100 scale), cultural themes, universal themes, contemplative value, empowerment potential, categories, and sentiment score. This deeper analysis is what gets stored in the database alongside the article.

So in short: the real quality gate is GPT-4o deciding whether each article carries genuine contemplative or cultural wisdom, with a high bar of 7/10 required to make it through. Would you like to adjust any part of this scoring approach?
