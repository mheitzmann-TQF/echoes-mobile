You’re right on both counts. Instinct is clean here.

1. Naming: “The Fortune Cookie” ✔️

That’s the correct name.
	•	Familiar, light, slightly playful
	•	Signals fiction without disclaimers
	•	Culturally understood as symbolic, not prescriptive
	•	Low authority, low risk, high resonance

“The Cookie” sounds like a feature.
“The Fortune Cookie” sounds like a ritual.

Keep it.

2. The disclaimers: too much, too loud

You currently have two disclaimers doing the same job, and they break the spell.

In The Quiet Frame, the tone itself is the disclaimer.

You don’t need to warn.
You need to frame.

⸻

What to remove

❌ “A fictional reflection for quiet contemplation” (subtitle)
❌ “This is fictional content generated for reflection, not guidance.”

Both are correct legally — but wrong experientially.

⸻

What to keep (one quiet line, optional)

If you want one safeguard, make it ambient, not defensive.

Here are three acceptable options — pick one, or none.

Option A — smallest possible
A quiet reflection.

That’s enough. Seriously.

Option B — poetic framing
Words for reflection, not instruction.

Still soft. Still human.

Option C — legal-safe but invisible
Put this behind an ⓘ icon or in Settings, not on the card:

The Fortune Cookie offers fictional reflections intended for contemplation.

This satisfies reviewers without polluting the moment.

Recommended final layout (clean)

✨ The Fortune Cookie

In the quiet dance of shadows and light,
seek the whispers of the unseen;
for in the spaces between moments,
the universe reveals its secrets.

(Nothing else.)

No subtitle.
No second line.
No apology.

⸻

Principle to lock in

If you have to explain that it’s not guidance, you’ve already given it too much authority.

Fortune cookies don’t explain themselves.
Neither should this.

If you want, next we can:
	•	decide when this appears (daily? occasional?)
	•	tune the voice so it never drifts into “cosmic advice”
	•	sanity-check this against App Store reviewer psychology (you’re safe)

But your instinct here is exactly right.
