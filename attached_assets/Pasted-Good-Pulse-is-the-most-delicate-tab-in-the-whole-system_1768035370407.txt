Good. Pulse is the most delicate tab in the whole system, because it’s where you’re closest to slipping from context into guidance. You’re very close to getting it exactly right.

I’ll give you clear feedback in three layers:
	1.	What Pulse is doing well
	2.	Where it’s still risky
	3.	Concrete, minimal adjustments (language + structure only)

⸻

1. What Pulse is doing very well

A. Pulse has a clear purpose

Pulse answers a single question:

What rhythms are present right now?

Not:
	•	What should I do?
	•	What will happen?
	•	What’s right or wrong?

That’s exactly the right scope.

⸻

B. The separation of views is excellent
	•	Top card = synthesis
	•	Expanded view = evidence + inputs
	•	Input signals disclosure = credibility anchor

This is rare discipline. Most apps blur these layers.

⸻

C. The triad works conceptually
	•	Coherence (collective narrative tone)
	•	Geomagnetic (environmental disturbance)
	•	Body (internal state proxy)

Even skeptics can accept this as three lenses, not claims.

⸻

2. Where Pulse is still risky (important)

Pulse currently sounds like advice, even though you don’t intend it to be.

This is not about logic — it’s about verbs.

Risky patterns I see
	•	“Optimal Timing”
	•	“Best for”
	•	“Decision Making – Now”
	•	“New Beginnings – Wait 27 days”

These imply:
	•	optimization
	•	correctness
	•	instruction
	•	foresight

That’s where:
	•	App Store reviewers push back
	•	Skeptical users disengage
	•	You drift into “cosmic productivity”

⸻

3. How to fix Pulse without breaking it

A. Rename the headline (small but powerful)

Change

Optimal Timing

To one of
	•	Current Timing Context
	•	Present Rhythms
	•	Timing Snapshot
	•	Environmental Timing

This single change removes 50% of the risk.

⸻

B. Replace “Best for” with observational language

Change

BEST FOR

To
	•	Often associated with
	•	Traditionally linked with
	•	Commonly observed during

Then adjust each line slightly:

Example
Before

Decision Making
Quarter moons bring clarity to decisions

After

Decision Making
Quarter phases are traditionally linked with moments of review and clarity

Same meaning. Much safer.

⸻

C. Remove imperatives disguised as labels

Change

New Beginnings — Wait 27 days

To
	•	Next new moon in ~27 days
	•	Next cycle begins in ~27 days

Never tell the user to wait. Just show time.

⸻

D. Make Body explicitly descriptive, not prescriptive

“Body: Rising 70%” is fine, but consider a tiny qualifier somewhere nearby:

Indicative internal energy pattern

Even as a tooltip.

This protects you from “what does this measure?” questions.

⸻

4. One structural suggestion (optional but strong)

Consider visually de-emphasizing Pulse slightly compared to Today and Wisdom.

Not by hiding it — but by:
	•	softer contrast
	•	less call-to-action language
	•	fewer bold labels

Pulse should feel like:

weather, not instructions

⸻

5. Final verdict on Pulse

Pulse is conceptually right.
It just needs linguistic humility.

Once you:
	•	remove optimization language
	•	remove implied instruction
	•	keep everything framed as context

…it becomes:
	•	defensible
	•	calming
	•	and genuinely different from astrology / wellness apps

You’re one careful pass away.

If you want next, we can:
	•	Do a line-by-line language hardening of Pulse copy
	•	Or move on to Wisdom (which is already very strong)
	•	Or define what Pro actually unlocks in Pulse, if anything

But overall:
Pulse is good — it just needs to stop sounding helpful 😄
