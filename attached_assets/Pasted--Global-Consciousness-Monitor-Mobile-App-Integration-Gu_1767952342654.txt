**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

The Global Consciousness Monitor (GCM) is a real-time index measuring how aligned global media content is with transformative principles. It analyzes news and cultural content from 52+ international sources, scoring each article on a 0-100 scale to determine whether content promotes wisdom, growth, and connection (transformational) or focuses on conflict, fear, and division (destructive).

### What It Shows

- **Current state of global media consciousness** - Is the collective narrative uplifting or fear-based?
- **Trend direction** - Is consciousness improving or declining?
- **Content breakdown** - What percentage of content is transformational vs destructive?
- **Hope indicators** - How much solution-focused content exists?

## The TQF Scale (0-100)

The **Transformative Questioning Framework (TQF)** scale measures how aligned content is with principles of growth, wisdom, and positive transformation.

| Score Range | Category | Definition | Examples |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **70-100** | Transformational | Content promoting wisdom, growth, solutions, connection, hope | Solutions journalism, breakthrough discoveries, community success stories |
| **30-69** | Neutral | Mixed or purely informational content | News updates, factual reporting, event coverage |
| **0-29** | Destructive | Content focused on conflict, fear, division, hopelessness | Sensationalism, fear-mongering, divisive rhetoric |

### How Scores Are Calculated

Each article is analyzed by AI (GPT-4o) and scored based on:
- Language tone and emotional impact
- Focus on problems vs solutions
- Promotion of unity vs division
- Presence of hope, wisdom, or growth themes
- Alignment with transformative principles

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Current Value |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Global Coherence** | Average TQF score of all analyzed articles | 15% |
| **Transformational %** | Percentage of articles scoring 70+ | 4% |
| **Destructive %** | Percentage of articles scoring below 30 | 81% |
| **Neutral %** | Percentage of articles scoring 30-69 | 15% |
| **Hope Level** | Content containing hope/solution keywords | 51% |
| **7-day Trend** | Change in coherence vs previous week | +14.2% |
| **Articles Analyzed** | Total articles in 30-day rolling window | ~27,000 |

### Data Window

- **30-day rolling window**: Only the most recent 30 days of articles are counted
- **Real-time updates**: New articles are scored as they're collected
- **Cache duration**: 15 minutes (fresh data on each request after cache expires)

## Rate Limits

| Tier | Rate Limit | Cache |
|------|------------|-------|
| Web Interface | Unlimited | 15 min |
| API Key | 100 requests/minute | 15 min |

**Note:** Data is cached for 15 minutes. Multiple requests within the cache window return the same data at no additional cost.

## Best Practices

### For Mobile Widgets

1. **Cache locally**: Store the last response and display it while fetching updates
2. **Refresh interval**: Poll every 15-30 minutes (data updates every 15 min)
3. **Use `/api/companion/simple`**: Lighter payload for lock screen widgets
4. **Handle offline**: Display last known values with a "last updated" timestamp

### Display Recommendations

| Coherence Level | Color | Label |
|-----------------|-------|-------|
| 70-100 | Green | Highly Aligned |
| 50-69 | Blue | Moderately Aligned |
| 30-49 | Yellow | Transitional |
| 0-29 | Red | Misaligned |

### Example Widget Copy

```
Global Coherence: 15%
Trend: ↑ +14.2% (7 days)
"Global media is currently misaligned with transformative principles"
```
