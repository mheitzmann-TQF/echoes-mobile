Cool — Learn needs to feel like a daily museum, not a blank page, and it must not repeat Today (no “today’s calendar tiles” again, no lunar/coherence tiles).

Here’s a Claude-ready Learn design spec you can hand off.

⸻

Learn tab (purpose)

Explore the systems behind the day.
Calendars as lenses. Culture as artifacts. Season as rhythm.

Not a snapshot. Not a dashboard.

⸻

Learn: Page layout (top to bottom)

1) HERO: “Calendar Systems” (the main event)

What it looks like

A horizontal carousel of big cards (one card nearly full width), each a system, not “today”.

Each card shows:
	•	System name (e.g., “Chinese Calendar”)
	•	Type tag (Civil / Lunar / Lunisolar / Sacred)
	•	1-line explainer (e.g., “Tracks months by the moon, corrected by the sun.”)
	•	A subtle “Rotate lens →” cue

Interactions
	•	Swipe to circle systems (this is your “circle through them” behavior)
	•	Tap opens a bottom sheet: “Today in this system”
	•	Today’s date in that calendar (allowed here)
	•	2–4 lines: how this calendar thinks
	•	Optional: 1 highlighted observance, if available

Anti-repeat rule

On the carousel card itself: no dates. Dates appear only in the sheet.

⸻

2) “Artifact of the Day” (one only, make it feel curated)

What it looks like

One featured card per day:
	•	Title
	•	Short excerpt (1–2 lines)
	•	Tag (Myth / Poem / Ritual / History / Saying)
	•	“Why this surfaced today” (one line, quiet)

Actions:
	•	Open
	•	Save (local bookmark)

Loading/fallback

Replace the “Discovering…” bar with:
	•	skeleton card while loading
	•	if empty response: a calm fallback card
	•	“No artifact surfaced today.”
	•	“Try again later.”

⸻

3) “Living Calendar” (2–3 rhythms max)

These are not “events” and not “today’s snapshot.”
They’re slow patterns.

Show 2–3 cards:
	•	Title (Seasonal Pattern / Light Shift / Threshold Week)
	•	1 sentence
	•	Tiny “Why now” line

Tap → detail sheet:
	•	short explanation
	•	optional link: “Carry into Quiet Frame”

⸻

4) “Saved” (tiny strip, local-only, very sticky)

A small horizontal strip at bottom:
	•	saved artifacts (covers/titles)
	•	saved calendar notes (system name + date)

No accounts.

⸻

Visual design language (so it looks premium)
	•	Keep the Learn page lighter in density than Today.
	•	Use:
	•	big whitespace
	•	fewer numbers
	•	large type
	•	cards with soft depth
	•	Each section gets a single strong card style. Avoid mixing 5 different card types.

⸻

Data mapping (use your existing endpoints)
	•	Calendar systems: /api/planetary/traditional-calendars (and/or anything in daily-bundle that returns the calendar list)
	•	Artifact: /api/cultural/content/high-alignment
	•	Living calendar: /api/sacred-geography/living-calendars

(These are all in your API doc.)  ￼

⸻

Paste to Claude (build instruction)

Redesign the Learn tab as a “daily museum” with 4 sections:
	1.	Calendar Systems carousel (big swipeable cards). Cards show system name + type + 1-line explainer, but NO dates on the card. Tap opens a bottom sheet showing “Today in this system” with the date and details.
	2.	Artifact of the Day (one curated card) using /api/cultural/content/high-alignment. Replace infinite “Discovering…” with skeleton + calm fallback. Add local Save.
	3.	Living Calendar (2–3 cards) using /api/sacred-geography/living-calendars, each with a “Why now” line and a detail sheet.
	4.	Saved strip (local-only bookmarks).
Enforce anti-repeat: Learn must not re-render Today’s calendar tiles or Today’s metrics tiles.

⸻

If you want, I can also write the exact microcopy templates for:
	•	the 1-line explainer per calendar type (civil/lunar/lunisolar/sacred)
	•	the “Why this surfaced today” line
so Claude doesn’t slip into generic filler.
