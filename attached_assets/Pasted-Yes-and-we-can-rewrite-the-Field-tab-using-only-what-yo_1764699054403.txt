Yes — and we can rewrite the Field tab using only what your API already gives, mainly from the planetary_context inside /api/echoes/daily-bundle plus optional enrichment from /api/echoes/instant and /api/planetary/current.  ￼

Below is a Claude-ready rewrite of the Field tab that avoids repeating Today.

⸻

Field tab: new job

Today = values + cards.
Field = “how to read + what changed + what inputs fed today’s Echoes.”

Non-repetition rule

On Field collapsed rows:
	•	show meaning + trend/delta only
	•	do not repeat: phase names, illumination %, time_to_sunset, coherence %

On Field expanded:
	•	you may show the value once, plus the explanation.

Field tab layout (final)

1) Header

Field
Cosmos · Earth · Body
Subtext: “How today’s signal is shaped”

⸻

2) “Since you last opened” (sticky + non-repeating)

A small card at top:

Shifts
	•	Coherence: Stable (or ▲ / ▼)
	•	Light: Deepening (derived from solar.phase only)
	•	Moon: Rising / Falling (derived from cached last illumination vs current, not displaying %)

Implementation:
	•	Store last snapshot locally from either daily-bundle.planetary_context or /api/echoes/instant.  ￼

⸻

3) Cosmos section (2 rows)

Row A — Lunar signal (collapsed)

Title: Lunar
One-liner (use planetary_context.lunar.message but rewrite short):
Example: “A phase that favors release and integration.”
Right side: chevron

Expanded view shows:
	•	Phase + illumination (now allowed): lunar.phase, lunar.illumination  ￼
	•	“How to read this” (2 bullets)
	•	“Common misread” (1 bullet)
	•	“Used in Echoes” (chips): phase, illumination

Row B — Solar signal (collapsed)

Title: Solar
One-liner from solar.message (shortened):
Example: “Attention narrows; closure energy rises.”
Expanded:
	•	solar.phase
	•	“Time to sunset” rendered nicely from time_to_sunset inside expanded only  ￼
	•	“How to read”
	•	“Used in Echoes” chips: current phase, sunset timing

⸻

4) Earth section (2 rows but no duplication)

Row C — Coherence (collapsed)

Title: Coherence
One-liner: interpret the trend not the number:
	•	rising → “Signal clarity is increasing.”
	•	falling → “Noise is rising; signals blur.”
	•	stable → “The field holds steady.”

Right microtext: Trend: rising/stable/falling (no %)

Expanded:
	•	Global coherence % + regional resonance % + trend (show here):
consciousness_index.global_coherence, regional_resonance, trend  ￼
	•	“How to read coherence” (ranges)
	•	“What it is in this system” (2 lines, no grand claims)
	•	“Used in Echoes” chips: global, regional, trend

Row D — Geomagnetic conditions (collapsed)

Title: Geomagnetic
One-liner derived from /api/echoes/instant.geomagnetic.activity or /api/planetary/current.geomagnetic.activity:
	•	Quiet → “Low disturbance.”
	•	Active → “Higher background friction.”  ￼
Right microtext: “Quiet / Active” (no kp index)

Expanded:
	•	show kp_index + activity + description (from /api/planetary/current)  ￼
	•	“How to read KP” (simple 3-step)
	•	“Used in Echoes” chips

Important: don’t label geomagnetism as “Coherent” (that collides with coherence).

⸻

5) Body section (1 row)

Row E — Biological rhythms (collapsed)

Title: Body
One-liner from /api/planetary/biological-rhythms.circadian.description but shortened.  ￼
Expanded:
	•	circadian phase + ultradian minutes remaining  ￼
	•	“How to read”
	•	“Gentle windows” list (avoid imperative “do this now”)

⸻

6) “Signals used today” (transparency block)

This is the anti-repetition clincher: it doesn’t restate results, it lists inputs.

Display as chips:
	•	Moon: phase, illumination
	•	Sun: phase, time to sunset
	•	Coherence: global, regional, trend
	•	Geomagnetic: activity, kp
	•	Seasonal: season, progress (from /api/echoes/instant.seasonal)  ￼

⸻

Copy rules (Claude must follow)
	•	Collapsed rows: no numbers and no repeating Today’s exact phrase (“Waxing gibbous”, “Sunset in 3h”, “68%”).
	•	Expanded panels: numbers are OK, but only once.
	•	Tone: descriptive, not directive (no “review your intentions”).

⸻

API plumbing (exact)
	•	Primary: /api/echoes/daily-bundle for lunar/solar/coherence messages and base context.  ￼
	•	Fast support: /api/echoes/instant for geomagnetic activity + seasonal.  ￼
	•	Deeper expansion (optional): /api/planetary/current + /api/planetary/biological-rhythms when user expands those rows.  ￼

⸻

If you want, I’ll now write the exact collapsed and expanded microcopy templates (like 2–3 canonical phrasings per state: rising/falling/stable, quiet/active, morning/afternoon/evening) so Claude can drop them in without inventing tone.
