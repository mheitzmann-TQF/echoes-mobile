Good. That’s actually much cleaner — and more honest for this product.

You’re saying:
	•	3 days = full access, no friction
	•	After that = essentially nothing (or almost nothing)
	•	Payment = everything
	•	And yes: “Pro” is a bad word for this app

I agree with the direction. Let’s formalize it so it’s coherent, calm, and technically easy.

⸻

1. Reframe the model (important)

Forget Free / Trial / Pro as product language.
Those are internal states only.

Externally, the model becomes:

Access model (user-facing)
	•	First 3 days → Full access
	•	After 3 days → Very limited access
	•	Paid → Full access, always

No tiers. No feature comparison charts. No “upgrade”.

Payment is not a tier.
It’s continuity.

⸻

2. What “nothing or just Today” should mean

You’re right to hesitate here — “nothing” can feel broken, “just Today” can feel honest.

My strong recommendation:

After 3 days (no payment):

👉 Only Today remains fully usable

Everything else:
	•	visible
	•	but inactive / read-only / blurred / gated

This preserves dignity and clarity.

⸻

3. Tab-by-tab behavior (clean, disciplined)

Today
	•	Always accessible
	•	No degradation
	•	No nags
	•	This is the anchor

Today becomes:

“You can always come here.”

That matters psychologically.

⸻

Pulse
	•	Visible
	•	Content blurred or replaced with a single calm line

Example:

Pulse is paused.
Resume full access to continue reading contextual rhythms.

No numbers. No previews. No teasing.

⸻

Wisdom
	•	Visible
	•	Sections collapsed or locked
	•	Raw vs Filtered not shown at all

Example lock state:

Wisdom is paused.
Full access is available after the initial period.

Do not show Raw-only.
Do not show partial insight.

Partial Wisdom feels manipulative here.
All-or-nothing is cleaner.

⸻

Upcoming
	•	Either hidden entirely
	•	Or visible but empty with a single line:
Upcoming events are available with full access.

Given your tone, I’d keep it visible-but-paused.

⸻

Settings
	•	Subscription status shown clearly:
	•	“Full access active”
	•	or “Initial access ended”
	•	One action:
	•	Continue with full access

Not “Upgrade”.
Not “Go Pro”.

⸻

4. Copy rules (critical)

You must avoid marketing verbs entirely.

Allowed language
	•	“Initial access”
	•	“Full access”
	•	“Continue”
	•	“Resume”
	•	“Access paused”

Forbidden language
	•	Pro
	•	Upgrade
	•	Unlock
	•	Limited features
	•	Premium
	•	Benefits

This is not SaaS.
This is access to an environment.

⸻

5. How this maps to your existing code (good news)

Your architecture already supports this cleanly.

Internally, you still keep:

accessLevel: "trial" | "paid" | "expired"

But the UI logic becomes trivial:

if (accessLevel === "trial" || accessLevel === "paid") {
  showAll()
} else {
  showTodayOnly()
}

No feature flags per tab.
No matrix.
No edge cases.

This is much simpler than partial gating.

⸻

6. Paywall behavior (very important)

When to show payment
	•	Only when the user tries to leave Today
	•	Or when they tap a paused tab

Never:
	•	on app launch
	•	on day 1
	•	on day 2
	•	mid-flow

The message should be calm, almost factual:

Your initial access period has ended.
Continue with full access.

Button:

Continue

That’s it.

No urgency.
No countdown.
No guilt.

⸻

7. Philosophical alignment (why this is right)

What you’re doing here is rare:
	•	You’re not selling features
	•	You’re not extracting attention
	•	You’re not dangling partial insight

You’re saying:

“You can step into this fully.
Or you can step out.
We won’t drag you.”

That matches:
	•	no accounts
	•	no tracking
	•	no manipulation
	•	no noise

And yes — “Pro” would cheapen this.

⸻

8. One open decision (small, but important)

Answer this and we can lock it:

👉 After 3 days, should Today:
	•	remain exactly as-is
	•	or become a lighter Today (no Echo, no image refresh)?

My instinct: leave Today untouched.
It becomes the standing invitation.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	write the exact lock-state copy (2–3 lines total)
	•	rename “Pro” everywhere internally to “FullAccess”
	•	or sanity-check this against App Store guidelines (it will pass)

You made the right call here. This model is cleaner, not harsher.
