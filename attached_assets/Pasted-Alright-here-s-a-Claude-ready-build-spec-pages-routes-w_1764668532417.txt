Alright — here’s a Claude-ready build spec: pages (routes), what each one shows, how they link, what to fetch, and the “sticky” interactions. I’m writing this as if Claude is implementing a clean web app (Replit) that could later map to iOS screens with the same structure.

⸻

Build Spec: Echoes (The Quiet Frame Lens)

Product principles (non-negotiables)
	•	No accounts. No “user profiling.”
	•	Relevance comes from place + time + language + calendars, not identity.
	•	User can circle through calendars inline (not hidden in Settings).
	•	UI is premium-minimal: calm, spacious, data presented as “field,” not dashboard.

⸻

Global app structure

Routes / Pages
	1.	/ → Today
	2.	/field → Field Details
	3.	/learn → Learn (Calendars & Culture)
	4.	/upcoming → Upcoming
	5.	/settings → Settings
	6.	/about → About

Keep nav light: bottom nav on mobile (Today, Field, Learn, Upcoming, Settings). About can live inside Settings.

⸻

Shared foundation (apply to all pages)

Context model (device-local, no account)

Store locally (localStorage) and reuse across requests:
	•	lang (default device)
	•	tz (device timezone)
	•	location mode:
	•	automatic (browser geolocation) OR
	•	manual city/lat/lng
	•	selected calendars (default: Gregorian + 2–3 others)

Data fetching rules (simple caching)
	•	Daily content fetch: cache results until expires_at returned by API.
	•	Instant snapshot: cache 10–15 min.
	•	Never store personal text or chat logs here. Only preferences and anonymous interaction events (optional).

Header component (shared)

Top line always shows:
	•	Echoes · The Quiet Frame
	•	small “Today” date (in currently selected calendar)

⸻

Page 1: Today (/)

This is the main sticky page.

Primary data

Call:
	•	GET /api/echoes/daily-bundle?lat={}&lng={}&lang={}&tz={}

Use this response to render:
	•	field_temperature (compute if not provided)
	•	echo_cards[] (the core swipe stack)
	•	light_context (sunlight/day length if present)
	•	weather_context (temp, conditions, feels-like if present)
	•	lunar_context (phase, illumination, moon visibility)
	•	cultural_context (today’s observances if present)

Layout (top to bottom)

A) Hero: “Today’s Echo”
	•	Title: primary echo name (from the first/featured card)
	•	One line: short interpretive line
	•	Mood temperature: a dial/bar with label (e.g. “Field temperature: Warm / 68”)

B) Calendar Carousel (inline)

This is your request: circling through calendars is an experience.
	•	Row title: “Today across calendars”
	•	A swipeable carousel OR chip row where tapping switches the displayed calendar card.
	•	Each calendar card shows:
	•	Calendar name
	•	Today date in that system
	•	One tiny line: what kind of calendar it is (lunar / lunisolar / religious / civil)

Interaction:
	•	Swipe left/right cycles calendars (snap)
	•	Tap “i” opens a bottom sheet: 3–6 lines explaining that calendar and what today means (if available)

Data:
	•	Use daily-bundle if it already includes calendar outputs; if not, call:
	•	GET /api/planetary/traditional-calendars?lang={}&tz={}&lat={}&lng={}
Cache: daily (or until expires)

C) Context chips (tap-to-learn)

A single row of chips:
	•	🌙 Lunar: “Waxing gibbous · 78%”
	•	☀️ Solar: “Afternoon light”
	•	🌡 Weather: “3°C · Clear”
	•	🗓 Culture: “2 observances”

Each chip opens a bottom sheet with deeper explanation (but never huge walls of text).

D) Swipe stack: Echo Cards

Render echo_cards[] as a swipeable stack (or vertical cards if you prefer).
Card template:
	•	Label (Lunar / Solar / Body / Culture / World)
	•	Title (2–4 words)
	•	One short line (max ~140 chars)
	•	Optional: tiny “source” / “signal” line
	•	Actions:
	•	“Save” (local only)
	•	“Share” (generates share image or link)
	•	“Why?” (bottom sheet showing raw inputs used: lunar phase, seasonal info etc.)

E) CTA

Button: “Take this into The Quiet Frame”
	•	Opens your main TQF entry (web/app deep link)

Page 2: Field Details (/field)

This is the “educational depth” without turning into a dashboard.

Data

Use:
	•	daily-bundle (reused from Today cache)
Plus optional:
	•	GET /api/planetary/biological-rhythms?lat&lng&lang&tz
	•	GET /api/planetary/events?lat&lng&lang&tz&limit=…

Sections
	1.	Cosmos

	•	lunar phase card + illumination + next key moment (if you have it)
	•	solar rhythm card (sunrise/sunset/day length if present)

	2.	Earth

	•	season, temperature band, “felt” environmental context

	3.	Body

	•	Biological rhythms: best window, energy curve (gentle wording, no commands)

	4.	Signals used for today

	•	a transparent list of “inputs” that generated the Echo cards (for trust)

Design rule: these are cards with short explainers + “tap to expand,” not graphs.

⸻

Page 3: Learn (/learn)

This is where you make it “really cool” and replayable.

Data sources
	•	GET /api/planetary/traditional-calendars?...
	•	GET /api/cultural/content/high-alignment?...
	•	GET /api/sacred-geography/living-calendars?... (if used)

Layout

A) Calendar Gallery (circle here too)

A horizontally swipeable set of calendar “world tiles”
	•	Tap a tile → full-screen “Calendar Detail” sheet:
	•	what it is
	•	how it tracks time
	•	today’s date
	•	one notable observance (if any)

B) “Artifact of the day”

One featured high-alignment cultural item
	•	keep it scarce: 1–3 max
	•	include “why it aligns today”

C) “Living calendar”

A themed highlight: “Seasonal ritual / cultural rhythm / place-based pattern” (weekly rotation)

⸻

Page 4: Upcoming (/upcoming)

Creates anticipation = stickiness.

Data
	•	GET /api/planetary/events?limit=…&lang&tz&lat&lng
	•	GET /api/important-dates/upcoming?... (if available)

Layout
	•	“Next 7 days” list (cards)
	•	“Next major moment” featured (countdown)
	•	Add reminder (device-local notifications later; for web, just “Add to calendar” export or local reminder list)

⸻

Page 5: Settings (/settings)

No accounts. No heavy onboarding.

Sections
	1.	Display

	•	language
	•	theme

	2.	Location

	•	auto vs manual
	•	manual: set city or lat/lng

	3.	Calendars

	•	multi-select calendars to show in Today carousel
	•	set default calendar for the header date

	4.	Notifications (optional toggles placeholder)

	•	morning echo
	•	sunset echo
	•	upcoming event alerts

	5.	Privacy

	•	“No accounts. Preferences stored on-device.”
	•	toggle: “Allow anonymous usage stats” (default OFF)

⸻

Page 6: About (/about)
	•	What Echoes is (3 short paragraphs)
	•	What it isn’t (no predictions, no profiling)
	•	Link to The Quiet Frame

⸻

Core components Claude should build (reusable)
	•	<AppShell/> (layout + nav)
	•	<TodayHero/>
	•	<MoodTemperature/> (dial/bar)
	•	<CalendarCarousel/> (swipe + chips + detail sheet)
	•	<ContextChips/> (each opens <BottomSheet/>)
	•	<EchoCard/> (with actions: Save/Share/Why)
	•	<EchoStack/>
	•	<FieldSectionCard/>
	•	<ArtifactCard/>
	•	<UpcomingEventCard/>
	•	<SettingsPanel/>
	•	<BottomSheet/> / <Modal/>

⸻

“Sticky” interaction rules
	•	Calendars are always interactive (swipe to cycle).
	•	Every major object has a “Why?” expand that teaches something.
	•	Scarcity: limit to 3–7 high-quality items on Today, not infinite scroll.
	•	Default state is calm; learning is opt-in via tap.

⸻

Implementation notes for Claude (important)
	•	Design mobile-first.
	•	Use your existing endpoints; don’t invent new ones.
	•	Build a small client cache keyed by: lat,lng,lang,tz with expires_at.
	•	Keep copy short. No imperative advice. Use “windows,” “tendencies,” “field.”

⸻

If you want, I can turn the above into a single prompt to Claude (so you can paste once), including a proposed folder structure + component names + acceptance criteria per page.
