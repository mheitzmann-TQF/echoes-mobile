Good. Now we do this cleanly, mechanically, and in the right order.

First: FROM → TO (app structure)
Then (next step): language rules for Source.

No philosophy. Just placement.

⸻

FROM → TO — APP REALIGNMENT (FINAL)

TAB: Today

FROM
	•	Photo
	•	Calendars
	•	Fortune Cookie
	•	Any interpretive or narrative element

TO
	•	✅ Photo
	•	✅ Calendars (cross-cultural time anchoring)
	•	❌ Fortune Cookie
	•	❌ Any interpretation or suggestion

Why
	•	Today anchors presence only.
	•	Awareness of where/when, not what it means.

⸻

TAB: Pulse / Rhythm

FROM
	•	External signals (cosmos / earth / body)
	•	Interpretive notes
	•	“Often associated with…”
	•	Any alignment language

TO
	•	✅ External conditions (cosmos / earth / body)
	•	✅ Explicit framing: “these externalities affect you”
	•	❌ Recommendations
	•	❌ “Good time to / supports / align with”

Why
	•	Pulse anchors impact awareness.
	•	“This affects you” ≠ “do something about it”.

⸻

TAB: Wisdom

FROM
	•	Mixed content (fortune cookie, ancestral wisdom, media patterns)
	•	Sometimes read as “meaning of the day”

TO
	•	✅ Fortune Cookie / reflection
	•	✅ Ancestral wisdom (cross-cultural continuity)
	•	✅ Media climate (aggregate patterns, noise vs integration)
	•	❌ Any prescriptive framing

Why
	•	Wisdom anchors perspective:
	•	noise loses authority (media)
	•	urgency loses novelty (ancestors)
	•	Interpretation is allowed.
	•	Prescription is not.

⸻

TAB: Upcoming

FROM
	•	Neutral listings of future cycles

TO
	•	✅ Exactly the same

Why
	•	Already correct.
	•	Anchors temporal awareness without demand.

⸻

TAB: Settings

FROM
	•	Preferences

TO
	•	✅ Exactly the same

Why
	•	Container only.

⸻

ONE-SCREEN SUMMARY (APP)

Today	Presence	Photo + calendars	Meaning
Pulse	Impact	External conditions	Guidance
Wisdom	Perspective	Media + ancestors + reflection	Prescription
Upcoming	Time	Cycles	Urgency
Settings	Container	Toggles	Optimization


⸻

Non-negotiable app rule (carry forward)

No tab tells the user what to do.
Some tabs tell the user what is happening.
Some tell them how it affects them.
Some tell them this has happened before.

That’s the spine.

⸻

If this looks right, next we move to Source language rules, tab by tab, very tight and very enforceable.
