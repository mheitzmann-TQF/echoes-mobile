Good.
If it’s confusing to you, it will be confusing to everyone else.

You’re trying to communicate something very simple:

There is a lot of media.
Most of it is reactive noise.
A small portion is integrative.
And even that small portion has a quality score.

Right now the UI makes people think they need to interpret a system instead of understand a message.

Let’s simplify the story.

⸻

What the screen currently says (cognitively)
	•	53,271 articles
	•	84% reactive
	•	13% observational
	•	3% integrative
	•	Raw Landscape score: 14
	•	Filtered Signal score: 78
	•	1,598 “wisdom articles”

That’s too many concepts competing.

People are asking:
	•	Is 14 bad?
	•	Is 78 good?
	•	What’s “Raw Landscape”?
	•	What’s “Filtered Signal”?
	•	Why are there two gauges?
	•	What is being scored exactly?

Your message is much simpler than your structure.

⸻

The Core Message (Boiled Down)

You want this:

1. Most media = reactive noise.
2. Very little media = integrative signal.
3. Even signal can be rated for depth/quality.

That’s it.

⸻

A Simpler Framing

Instead of two gauges and five conceptual layers, try this structure:

⸻

HEADLINE

Global Media Climate

Subheadline:
Most coverage is reactive. Only a small fraction integrates.

⸻

SECTION 1 – The Landscape

Out of 53,271 articles analyzed:
	•	🔴 84% Reactive (conflict, fear, division)
	•	⚪ 13% Observational (neutral reporting)
	•	🟢 3% Integrative (solutions, connection)

That’s the punch.

No gauge needed.

⸻

SECTION 2 – The Signal

Then:

Wisdom Signal

1,598 integrative articles were analyzed for quality.

Average Integration Score: 78 / 100

Short explanation:

Integrative articles score based on depth, solution-orientation, and cross-perspective awareness.

Now it’s clean:
	•	Big pool → mostly noise.
	•	Small pool → higher quality.
	•	Score applies only to that small pool.

⸻

Why Your Current Version Feels Confusing

1. “Raw Landscape” sounds abstract

It’s actually just distribution.

2. The 14 score is unclear

What is 14 measuring?
It looks like a rating, but it’s actually an index of reactivity density.

People assume:
14 = bad
78 = good
But they don’t know what the scale means.

3. Two gauges = cognitive friction

Two arcs compete for attention.
Humans assume equal importance.

But they’re not equal:
	•	One describes composition.
	•	One describes quality.

⸻

Even More Radical Simplification

If you want the bold version:

⸻

Most Media is Reactive

84% of global coverage is driven by conflict, fear, and division.

Only 3% is integrative.

⸻

The Integrative Minority Scores 78/100 on Depth

(1,598 articles analyzed)

⸻

That’s powerful.
No metaphors. No abstraction.

⸻

If You Want To Keep the Visual Style

Then change the logic:

Replace:
	•	“Raw Landscape: 14”
	•	“Filtered Signal: 78”

With:
	•	“Media Reactivity: 84%”
	•	“Wisdom Quality: 78/100”

Now the labels explain themselves.

⸻

The Strategic Question

Do you want this to feel:
	•	Analytical?
	•	Philosophical?
	•	Or emotionally clear?

Right now it’s analytical-abstract.
Your message is philosophical-clear.

Align those.

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	Rewrite the exact UI copy
	•	Propose a new information hierarchy
	•	Or redesign the conceptual model so it matches your Sherpa voice

But first:

Do you want this to feel like a dashboard
or like a wake-up call?
