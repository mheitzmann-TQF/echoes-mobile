Yes — and this is a good moment to do it, because your access model, privacy stance, and tone are now settled. The Terms should reflect that restraint.

Below is a clean, minimal Terms of Service draft, written to be:
	•	App Store–acceptable
	•	legally sane (without pretending to be a law firm)
	•	aligned with no accounts, no manipulation, no advice
	•	neutral in tone (not defensive, not salesy)

This is not jurisdiction-specific legal advice, but it’s an excellent baseline that many indie apps ship with.

Terms of Service

Last updated: [DATE]

Welcome to The Quiet Frame – Echoes (“the App”).

By using the App, you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

⸻

1. What the App Is

Echoes is a reflective application that presents contextual information, patterns, and cultural or environmental markers.
It is designed to support awareness and reflection.

The App does not provide:
	•	professional advice (medical, psychological, financial, legal, or otherwise)
	•	predictions or guarantees
	•	instructions or recommendations for action

All content is provided for informational and reflective purposes only.

⸻

2. No Accounts, No Profiles

Echoes does not require user accounts.

We do not create personal profiles, track user behavior across sessions, or associate usage with an identifiable individual. Access to paid features is managed using a device-based identifier solely for subscription validation.

⸻

3. Access and Subscriptions

Echoes provides an initial period of full access. After this period, access may pause unless continued through a paid subscription.

Subscriptions:
	•	are handled through Apple App Store or Google Play
	•	renew automatically unless canceled through the platform’s subscription settings
	•	are subject to the terms of the respective app store

Echoes does not manage billing directly and cannot modify subscriptions on your behalf.

⸻

4. Content and Interpretation

Content in the App may include:
	•	aggregated media patterns
	•	cultural or traditional timekeeping references
	•	astronomical or environmental data

Such content:
	•	is contextual, not causal
	•	is not personalized
	•	should not be interpreted as guidance, instruction, or prediction

You are responsible for how you interpret and use any information presented.

⸻

5. Geographic and Cultural Scope

Echoes draws on sources, traditions, and markers from multiple regions and cultures. The presence or absence of specific content does not imply completeness, endorsement, or prioritization.

⸻

6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
	•	misuse or attempt to interfere with the App’s functionality
	•	reverse engineer or exploit the App or its services
	•	use the App for unlawful purposes

⸻

7. Availability and Changes

We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the App at any time. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

⸻

8. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law:
	•	The App is provided “as is”
	•	We make no warranties regarding accuracy, completeness, or suitability
	•	We are not liable for decisions or actions taken based on the App’s content

Notes / recommendations
	•	Keep this short and readable (which it is).
	•	Pair it with an equally minimal Privacy Policy (even simpler, given no accounts).
	•	Host it at a stable URL and link it from:
	•	Settings
	•	App Store listing

If you want next, I can:
	•	draft the Privacy Policy to match this exactly (it will be very short)
	•	sanity-check this against Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines
	•	adapt wording for a specific jurisdiction (EU/CH/US)

This ToS fits the product you’ve actually built — not a generic SaaS shell.
