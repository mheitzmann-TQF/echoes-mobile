This is mostly very good — clear, accurate, reviewer-friendly.
You didn’t forget anything major, but there are two small corrections and a few edge clarifications that would make it bullet-proof.

I’ll go straight to signal.

⸻

1. One factual correction (important)

“logs into a new Apple/Google account”

This part is not correct and could get flagged.

Restore does not work across different Apple IDs / Google accounts.

Correct framing:
	•	Reinstall app ✅
	•	New device ✅
	•	Same Apple ID / Google account ✅
	•	Different account ❌ (nothing to restore)

Suggested fix:

“User reinstalls the app or installs it on a new device using the same Apple ID / Google account”

This matters because Apple reviewers are picky about account expectations.

⸻

2. Flow logic: technically sound ✅

Your restore flow itself is correct and clean:
	•	App asks store for purchase history
	•	Receipts come from Apple/Google
	•	Server verifies (same path as purchase)
	•	Entitlement granted only if active

This line is especially strong and worth keeping verbatim:

“Restored purchases go through the same validation as new ones”

That’s exactly what Apple wants to hear.

⸻

3. One thing to name explicitly (clarity, not missing logic)

You may want to add one short clarification about expired subscriptions, to avoid ambiguity:

Right now:

“If none found → shows ‘No purchases found’”

But in reality there are two cases:
	•	No purchases ever
	•	Purchases found but expired

Suggested refinement:
	•	If active subscription found → grant access
	•	If only expired subscriptions found → show “No active subscription”
	•	If no purchases found → show “No purchases found”

This avoids confusion and reduces support tickets later.

⸻

4. Dev-mode note: fine, but consider tone

“In dev mode: Tapping restore just sets the dev override to paid”

This is okay internally, but if this text is ever reused externally or in review notes, I’d soften it slightly:

“In development builds, restore can simulate an active entitlement for testing purposes.”

Same meaning, less “backdoor-ish” wording.

⸻

5. Optional edge cases (only if you want maximum rigor)

You don’t need to implement these now — just acknowledging them increases credibility.

You could add a short “Notes” section mentioning:
	•	Grace periods (treated as active entitlement, if applicable)
	•	Refunds / chargebacks (handled automatically on next verification)
	•	Cross-platform (iOS ↔ Android subscriptions are not transferable)
	•	Family Sharing (subscriptions typically not shared unless explicitly enabled)

Even one sentence like:

“Restore respects store policies regarding grace periods, refunds, and platform separation.”

…is enough.

⸻

Bottom line

Is it any good?
Yes — this is clean, accurate, and review-safe.

Did you forget something?
No — just:
	•	fix the “new account” wording
	•	optionally distinguish expired vs none found

That’s polish, not repair.

You’re very clearly in the “tightening language because the system already works” phase now.
